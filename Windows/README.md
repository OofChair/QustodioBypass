# Executing a script
Executing the script is done by clicking on MonitorConfig.bat once downloaded

# Creating a shortcut
Just make a shortcut linking to MonitorConfig.bat

# Notes
Unfortunately you need Admin privileges to run the scripts
Tampering with the code could result in it failing
Credits to Matt for his Elevate.cmd script
