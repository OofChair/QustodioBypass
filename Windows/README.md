# Installation
Download the MonitorConfig.bat, found under the Monitor Config folder

# Executing the script
Executing the script is done by clicking on MonitorConfig.bat once downloaded

# Features
We currently have 3 features, these are
- "close" = stops qustodio from working | "open" = allows qustodio to work
- "nuke" = stops qustodio from working and then deletes it (Note: This might trigger a warning to parents about your actions and the service sitting in your system-tray will remain)
- "delay" = Puts the qengine and qupdate services last in the boot sequence

# Creating a shortcut
Just make a shortcut linking to MonitorConfig.bat

# Notes
Unfortunately you need Admin privileges to run the scripts
Tampering with the code could result in it failing
