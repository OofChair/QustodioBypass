here is the most reliable way we have found for IOS as of yet

go to vpn setting (questudio runs off a vpn)

turn off airplane mode

find connect of demand setting and the vpn on off

disable the connect on demand but quickly turn off airplane mode and re enable the vpn from the vpn setting

now connect on demand should be off and vpn should be on (the vpn being on will prevent the software from noticing that conect on demand is off

reboot your phone

dont open settings

repeat whenever it reenables
