2. Run the configuration script (Found under the configure section)
3. Now you can move the folder with the scripts in to wherever you want. Just remember to run them with terminal

# Configure
When you've downloaded the folder to your downloads script, run the following script

cd Downloads
cd "Monitor Config"
chmod 700 close.sh
chmod 700 open.sh
